# AsyncStorage Error in Expo Lifecycle Method

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications. The error occurs when trying to access AsyncStorage within a component's lifecycle method (e.g., componentDidMount).  This is often due to AsyncStorage not being fully initialized before the method is executed. The solution involves using a `useEffect` hook or a Promise to ensure AsyncStorage is ready.

## Problem

When accessing AsyncStorage during component mounting, an error might occur if AsyncStorage isn't fully initialized.  The provided `bug.js` file illustrates this problematic code.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the fix using `useEffect`.  This hook allows you to perform side effects after the component renders. By using `useEffect` with an empty dependency array, the asynchronous operation happens once after the component mounts, ensuring AsyncStorage is ready.
